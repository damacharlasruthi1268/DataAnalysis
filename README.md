Project Explanation: Local File to Databricks ETL Pipeline

This (Copying Files to BLOB from Local) Python Jupyter Notebook project aims to facilitate the process of loading the latest file from a specific path on the local machine to Azure Blob storage. From there, the file can be accessed and processed in Databricks(ETL Process) using the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) approach.

The project consists of the following steps:

1. Loading the Latest File: The Python script identifies the latest file in a specified path on the local machine. This is achieved by retrieving the file's creation or modification timestamp and comparing it with other files in the directory. The script selects the most recently modified or created file as the latest file to be processed.

2. Uploading to Azure Blob Storage: Once the latest file is identified, it is uploaded to Azure Blob storage. Azure Blob storage provides scalable, secure storage for various data types, including files. The file is stored in the Blob storage container for easy access by other services and applications.

3. Accessing the File in Databricks: After the file is stored in Blob storage, it can be accessed from within a Databricks environment. Databricks is a unified analytics platform that provides a collaborative environment for big data and machine learning. The Blob storage container is mounted in Databricks, allowing seamless access to the files it contains.

4. Extracting the File: Within the Databricks environment, the file is extracted from the Blob storage. The file could be in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, or Parquet. The appropriate method is used to read and parse the file data, creating a DataFrame or RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) in Databricks.

5. Transformation: The extracted data is transformed to prepare it for analysis or further processing. This involves cleaning the data by removing unnecessary rows or columns, filling in null values, and deriving new columns based on existing ones. The data is reshaped and organized in a more understandable and structured manner to facilitate subsequent analysis.

6. Loading Data into a Databricks Table: Finally, the transformed data is loaded into a Databricks table. A Databricks table is a structured collection of data that can be queried and analyzed using SQL or other programming languages. By loading the data into a table, it becomes easier to perform complex queries, aggregations, and analytics on the dataset within Databricks.

Overall, this project automates the process of loading the latest file from a local path to Azure Blob storage, making it accessible in a Databricks environment. The extracted data is then transformed and loaded into a Databricks table for further analysis and processing. This pipeline enhances data agility and enables efficient data-driven decision-making within the Databricks environment.
